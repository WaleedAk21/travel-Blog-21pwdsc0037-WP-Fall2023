        <h2>Story 1: Exploring the Burj Khalifa</h2><br>
        <p>Our journey to Dubai began with a visit to the iconic Burj Khalifa. The views from the observation deck were breathtaking, and we captured some amazing photos of the city.
            At 828m tall, this magnificent structure is located next to Dubai Mall and has drawn visitors from all over the world since opening in 2010. The unmatched Burj Khalifa view can be taken in from not one but two observations decks the two-storey At the Top on the 124th and 125th floors, as well as one of the worlds highest observation decks (555m) on the 148th floor.

        <h2>story 4:Dubai Frame</h2>
        <p>The Dubai Frame is one of the city’s most famous attractions for visitors and residents alike. Much like the Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab's iconic structures, the building's landmark location in Zabeel Park provides panoramic views of the city.
        At 150m tall and 93m wide with a bridge connecting the two towers, Dubai Frame has a unique concept to its structure. Resembling a picture frame, Dubai's historic district can be seen to the north while the south provides breathtaking vistas of the modern cityscape.                 
        <br>Things to do :<br>
        Beyond the stunning views, visitors can experience the past, present and future from the ground to the sky. For example, the story of the city’s past is told using the latest technology, combining animations and holographic effects with traditional music and aromatic scents to transport visitors back in time.
        Step onto the clear 50m-long opaque glass bridge at the Sky Deck. Crafted from liquid crystal with an underlying film triggered by sensors, the floor becomes clear only when a visitor walks over it. Peer at the ground beneath, all while feeling like you’re walking on air.
